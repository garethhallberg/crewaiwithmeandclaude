    ANALYZE THE EXISTING iOS APP STRUCTURE FOR POST CREATION
    
    **YOUR MISSION:**
    Study the existing TwitterClone iOS app to understand:
    
    1. **Current Architecture Patterns:**
       - How does LoginView/LoginViewModel work together?
       - How does RegistrationView/RegistrationViewModel work together? 
       - What's the established MVVM pattern in this app?
    
    2. **Navigation Flow:**
       - How does the app navigate between screens?
       - Where do authenticated users end up after login?
       - How should post creation fit into the user journey?
    
    3. **Existing Components:**
       - What UI components are already available?
       - What networking patterns are established?
       - What models/data structures exist?
    
    4. **Design Language:**
       - What's the visual style of forms and buttons?
       - How are text inputs handled?
       - What's the color scheme and typography?
    
    **FIGURE OUT:**
    - Where should users access post creation from?
    - What should the post creation experience feel like?
    - How can this feature follow the same patterns as login/registration?
    
    **NO CODE YET** - Just analyze and understand the existing system.

    RESEARCH THE BACKEND API FOR POST CREATION
    
    **YOUR MISSION:**
    Study the existing backend to understand:
    
    1. **Post Creation Endpoint:**
       - What endpoint handles post creation?
       - What HTTP method and data format?
       - What authentication is required?
    
    2. **Data Requirements:**
       - What fields are needed to create a post?
       - Are there any validation rules?
       - What's the response format?
    
    3. **Integration Patterns:**
       - How do the existing login/registration calls work?
       - What's the pattern for authenticated API calls?
       - How are errors handled?
    
    4. **Post Model:**
       - What does a post object look like?
       - What properties does it have?
       - How should it be represented in iOS?

    - How to handle success and error cases
    - What the user should see after creating a post

    DESIGN HOW POST CREATION FITS INTO THE APP
    
    **YOUR MISSION:**
    Based on the architectural analysis and API research, design:
    
    1. **User Experience Flow:**
       - Where/how do users access post creation?
       - What's the step-by-step user journey?
       - How do they get back to the main app after posting?
    
    2. **Technical Integration:**
       - What new View and ViewModel are needed?
       - How do they connect to existing networking?
       - How does navigation work?
    
    3. **Feature Scope:**
       - What's the minimum viable post creation?
       - What features can wait for later?
       - How complex should the first version be?
    
    4. **Implementation Strategy:**
       - What needs to be built first?
       - How can this follow the successful patterns from login/registration?
       - What are the key architectural decisions?
    
    **FIGURE OUT:**
    - The complete plan for implementing post creation
    - How it integrates seamlessly with existing code
    - What the user experience should be
    
    **OUTPUT A STRATEGY** - Don't write code yet, design the approach.
