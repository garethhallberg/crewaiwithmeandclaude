    # Task 1: Create Missing PostLike Entity and Repository
    missing_entities_task = Task(
        description='''
        You must create the missing PostLike entity and PostLikeRepository that you referenced but never created.
        
        CURRENT PROBLEM:
        The PostService references PostLike entity and PostLikeRepository, but these files don't exist.
        This is causing compilation errors in the post-service.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        Create these specific files that will be written to disk:
        
        1. PostLike.kt - JPA entity for post likes/hearts
        2. PostLikeRepository.kt - Spring Data JPA repository interface
        
        CRITICAL: These must match the usage in PostService exactly.
        
        For PostLike.kt, include:
        - Extend BaseEntity for audit fields
        - @Entity and @Table annotations with unique constraints
        - @ManyToOne relationship to Post entity
        - userId field as UUID (not User entity reference)
        - Proper indexes for performance
        - Constructor methods
        
        For PostLikeRepository.kt, include:
        - Extend JpaRepository<PostLike, UUID>
        - existsByPostIdAndUserId(postId: UUID, userId: UUID): Boolean
        - deleteByPostIdAndUserId(postId: UUID, userId: UUID)
        - countByPostId(postId: UUID): Long
        - Any other methods used in PostService
        
        OUTPUT: Complete PostLike.kt and PostLikeRepository.kt files.
        ''',
        agent=kotlin_api_developer,
        expected_output='Complete PostLike.kt entity and PostLikeRepository.kt interface that match PostService usage'
    )

    # Task 2: Identify and Fix Any Other Missing Dependencies
    missing_dependencies_task = Task(
        description='''
        You must identify and create any other missing entities or repositories referenced in the codebase.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        Analyze the entire post-service codebase and identify:
        - Any other missing entity classes referenced but not created
        - Missing repository interfaces
        - Missing DTO classes that cause compilation errors
        - Any imports that reference non-existent files
        
        Create any missing files needed for successful compilation.
        
        CRITICAL: Ensure all references in the codebase have corresponding implementations.
        
        Check these files for missing references:
        - PostService.kt
        - PostController.kt  
        - TimelineController.kt
        - All entity classes
        - All repository interfaces
        
        OUTPUT: List of missing files identified and created.

        agent=kotlin_api_architect,
        expected_output='Complete list of missing dependencies identified and resolved'

    # Task 3: Conduct Development Process Retrospective
    process_retrospective_task = Task(
        description='''
        You must conduct a detailed retrospective on how you wrote tests for non-existent code.
        
        CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIRED:
        Analyze this specific development failure and provide insights.
        
        QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
        1. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
        - How did you write PostService code that referenced PostLike without creating it?
        - How did you write tests for PostService without ensuring dependencies existed?
        - What was the breakdown in your development process?
        
        2. WHY WASN'T THIS CAUGHT EARLIER?
        - Why didn't you verify that referenced entities existed?
        - How did the testing task proceed without compilation checks?
        - What validation steps were missing from your process?
        
        3. WHAT DOES THIS REVEAL ABOUT AI DEVELOPMENT?
        - What are the limitations of AI code generation workflows?
        - How should AI agents validate their own generated code?
        - What checks should be built into the development process?
        
        4. PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:
        - How should CrewAI agents coordinate better on dependencies?
        - What validation steps should be added to each task?
        - How can agents ensure completeness before moving to next phase?
        
        5. LESSONS FOR HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION:
        - What role should humans play in validating AI-generated code?
        - How can this type of oversight be prevented in future?
        - What are the implications for AI-driven development workflows?
        
        CRITICAL: Be brutally honest about the failure and provide actionable insights.
        
        OUTPUT: Comprehensive process analysis with specific recommendations.
