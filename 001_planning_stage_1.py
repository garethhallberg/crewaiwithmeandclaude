        description='''
        Create a comprehensive requirements analysis for a multi-platform Twitter clone MVP.
        
        TARGET PLATFORMS:
        - Native iOS app (iPhone/iPad)
        - Native Android app 
        - React.js web application
        - Backend API (to serve all client platforms)
        
        Include:
        1. Core features for MVP (prioritized list) across all platforms (mobile + web)
        2. User personas and user journey mapping for mobile and web users
        3. Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria for mobile and web experiences
        4. Platform-specific considerations (iOS vs Android vs Web features)
        5. Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability) for mobile + web + backend
        6. Success metrics and KPIs for mobile app adoption and web engagement
        7. Scope definition (what's IN and what's OUT for MVP) for each platform
        8. API requirements to support mobile and web functionality
        9. Cross-platform feature parity and differences
        
        Focus on creating a realistic multi-platform MVP (mobile-first with web support) that can be built by a small team with backend, mobile, and web expertise.
        Consider offline capabilities, push notifications for mobile, and responsive web design.
        
        Provide a detailed, structured document with clear sections for each requirement area.

    # Technical Planning Task
    technical_planning_task = Task(
        description='''
        Based on the requirements analysis provided by the Business Analyst, create a detailed technical project plan for a comprehensive multi-platform Twitter clone.
        
        REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY STACK:
        - Backend: Kotlin with Spring Boot (team expertise in JVM/Kotlin)
        - Containerization: Docker for backend API deployment and development consistency
        - Mobile: Native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) and Android (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) apps
        - Web Frontend: React.js for dynamic, responsive web interface
        - Database: PostgreSQL for main data, Redis for caching
        - Real-time: WebSockets for live features across all platforms
        - Deployment: Docker containers with orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker Compose)
        
        Create a comprehensive technical plan that includes:
        1. Technology stack implementation plan (Dockerized Kotlin Spring Boot backend, iOS Swift, Android Kotlin, React.js web)
        2. Multi-platform architecture (unified backend API in Docker containers serving mobile and web clients)
        3. Docker containerization strategy for backend services and local development
        4. Development phases and timeline for backend + mobile + web development
        5. Team coordination strategy for backend, mobile, and web teams
        6. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies across all platforms
        7. CI/CD and deployment strategy for containerized backend, mobile apps, and web application
        8. Testing and quality assurance approach across all platforms
        9. API design strategy for mobile and web client communication
        10. Infrastructure and DevOps considerations for containerized deployment
        11. Shared component strategy and platform-specific optimizations
        
        Focus on leveraging the team's JVM/Kotlin expertise while building native mobile experiences and a modern web application.
        Emphasize Docker containerization for consistent deployment and development environments.
        Provide realistic estimates and identify potential bottlenecks for multi-platform development.
        
        Create a detailed, structured technical document with clear sections and actionable recommendations.
