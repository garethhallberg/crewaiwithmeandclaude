    # Task 1: Fix PostServiceTest Method Signatures
    test_signature_fix_task = Task(
        description='''
        You must fix the PostServiceTest.kt method signatures to match the updated PostService.
        
        CURRENT ERROR:
        "No value passed for parameter 'username'" in PostServiceTest.kt line 49
        
        PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
        The PostService.createPost method signature was changed to include username parameter:
        - OLD: createPost(request: CreatePostRequest): PostDto
        - NEW: createPost(request: CreatePostRequest, username: String): PostDto
        
        But the test is still calling the old signature without the username parameter.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        Update PostServiceTest.kt to fix all method calls that don't match service signatures:
        
        1. Fix createPost test calls - add username parameter
        2. Check other method calls for signature mismatches
        3. Add proper test data for username parameter
        4. Ensure all test assertions still work
        
        CRITICAL: Update the test file with correct method signatures.
        
        Example fix needed:
        ```kotlin
        // OLD (broken):
        val result = postService.createPost(request)
        
        // NEW (fixed):
        val result = postService.createPost(request, "testuser")
        ```
        
        OUTPUT: Complete corrected PostServiceTest.kt file content.
        ''',
        agent=kotlin_api_developer,
        expected_output='Fixed PostServiceTest.kt with correct method signatures matching PostService'
    )

    # Task 2: Check and Fix All Test Files
    comprehensive_test_fix_task = Task(
        description='''
        You must check all test files for method signature mismatches and fix them.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        Scan and fix these test files if they have signature mismatches:
        
        1. UserServiceTest.kt - Check if method signatures match UserService
        2. PostServiceTest.kt - Already identified, but double-check completeness
        3. Any other test files that might have similar issues
        
        For each test file:
        - Compare test method calls with actual service method signatures
        - Update test calls to match current service implementations
        - Add necessary test data for new parameters
        - Ensure all assertions still validate correctly
        
        CRITICAL: Ensure all tests can compile and run successfully.
        
        OUTPUT: List of all test files checked and fixed.

    # Task 3: Test Maintenance Process Analysis
    test_maintenance_analysis_task = Task(
        description='''
        You must analyze why tests broke when service methods changed and how to prevent this.
        
        CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIRED:
        Examine the test maintenance breakdown in the development process.
        
        QUESTIONS TO ANALYZE:
        1. WHY DID TESTS BREAK?
        - How did service method signatures change without updating tests?
        - What coordination failed between service development and test writing?
        - Why weren't tests validated when services were modified?
        
        2. TEST-CODE SYNCHRONIZATION ISSUES:
        - How should tests be maintained when implementation changes?
        - What process should ensure test-service method signature consistency?
        - When should tests be updated in the development workflow?
        
        3. AI DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW GAPS:
        - How should CrewAI agents coordinate between implementation and test tasks?
        - What validation steps should check test-implementation consistency?
        - How can automated checks prevent signature mismatches?
        
        4. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ROBUST TESTING:
        - What process should update tests when implementations change?
        - How can AI agents ensure test maintainability?
        - What checks should be built into the development workflow?
        
        5. BROADER IMPLICATIONS:
        - What does this reveal about AI code generation consistency?
        - How should human oversight ensure test-implementation alignment?
        - What are best practices for AI-generated test maintenance?
        
        CRITICAL: Provide actionable recommendations for maintaining test consistency.
