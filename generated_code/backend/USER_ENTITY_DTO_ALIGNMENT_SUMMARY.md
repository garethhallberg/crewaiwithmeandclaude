# User Entity DTO Alignment Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
- User entity was missing properties that UserDto expected
- Type mismatches between entity and DTO
- UserDtoMapper compilation failures

## Properties Added to User Entity
- location: String? (nullable)
- website: String? (nullable)  
- followersCount: Int (default 0)
- followingCount: Int (ensured Int type, not Long)

## Fixes Applied
1. Updated User.kt entity with missing properties
2. Fixed UserDtoMapper.kt to access correct properties
3. Ensured type consistency (Int for count fields)
4. Added proper JPA annotations and database column names
5. Created migration script for database schema updates

## Validation
- All UserDto properties now have corresponding User entity properties
- No type mismatches between entity and DTO
- UserDtoMapper compiles without errors
- Service classes can use mapper successfully
