    # Task 1: Fix PostLike Inheritance Error
    inheritance_fix_task = Task(
        description='''
        You must fix the Kotlin inheritance error in PostLike.kt.
        
        CURRENT ERROR:
        "Supertype initialization is impossible without primary constructor"
        at line 22 in PostLike.kt: class PostLike : BaseEntity() {
        
        PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
        The error occurs because BaseEntity doesn't have a primary constructor,
        but the code is trying to call BaseEntity() with parentheses.
        
        SOLUTION REQUIRED:
        Fix the inheritance syntax in PostLike.kt to match the correct Kotlin pattern.
        
        CRITICAL: You made this same mistake before with User entity and it was fixed.
        You should learn from that previous fix.
        
        The correct syntax should be:
        - WRONG: class PostLike : BaseEntity() {
        - CORRECT: class PostLike : BaseEntity {
        
        Also fix any constructor calls that reference super():
        - WRONG: constructor() : super()
        - CORRECT: constructor()
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        Update the PostLike.kt file with the correct Kotlin inheritance syntax.
        Ensure the file compiles without the supertype initialization error.
        
        OUTPUT: Corrected PostLike.kt file content.

    # Task 2: Pattern Recognition and Learning Analysis
    pattern_analysis_task = Task(
        description='''
        You must analyze why this same inheritance mistake keeps happening.
        
        CRITICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION:
        This is the SAME inheritance error that occurred with the User entity earlier.
        It was fixed then, but the mistake was repeated with PostLike.
        
        QUESTIONS TO ANALYZE:
        1. WHY DID THIS PATTERN REPEAT?
        - Why wasn't the lesson from fixing User entity applied to PostLike?
        - How can AI agents learn from previous fixes?
        - What causes the same mistake to be repeated?
        
        2. WHAT DOES THIS REVEAL ABOUT AI LEARNING?
        - Do AI agents retain knowledge from previous tasks?
        - How should fixes be propagated to prevent repetition?
        - What are the limitations of AI pattern recognition?
        
        3. PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
        - How should CrewAI agents share learnings across tasks?
        - What validation templates should be created?
        - How can similar errors be prevented in future?
        
        4. HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION INSIGHTS:
        - When should humans intervene to prevent repeated mistakes?
        - How can AI development processes include learning mechanisms?
        - What are the implications for scalable AI development?
        
        CRITICAL: Provide actionable insights for preventing repeated errors.
        
        OUTPUT: Analysis of why the same mistake was repeated and recommendations.
