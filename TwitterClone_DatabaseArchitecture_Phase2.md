# Database Architecture - Phase 2

The comprehensive database architecture for a Twitter clone involves creating a robust and scalable system capable of handling large volumes of data and high concurrency levels. Below is a detailed plan covering PostgreSQL schema design, Redis caching strategy, data management patterns, performance optimization, backup, and recovery strategies.

### 1. PostgreSQL Schema Design:

#### Core Entity Models:
- **Users**: `user_id (PK), username, email, hash_password, created_at, last_login, bio, privacy_settings`
- **Posts/Tweets**: `post_id (PK), user_id (FK), content, media_url, created_at, updated_at, likes_count, retweets_count`
- **Social Graph**: `relationship_id (PK), follower_id (FK -> Users), following_id (FK -> Users), created_at`
- **Timeline**: Stored as views based on Posts/Tweets and Social Graph data
- **Notifications**: `notification_id (PK), user_id (FK), type, message, is_read, created_at`
- **Direct Messages**: `message_id (PK), sender_id (FK -> Users), receiver_id (FK -> Users), message, created_at`

#### Indexing Strategy:
- Hash indexes on `username` and `email` in `Users` for fast lookup.
- B-Tree indexes on `created_at` fields across all entities for time-based queries.
- GIN index on `content` of Posts/Tweets for full-text search capabilities.

#### Constraints and Data Integrity:
- Use `NOT NULL` constraints on critical fields (e.g., `username`, `email`, `content`).
- Apply `UNIQUE` constraints on `username` and `email`.
- Enforce foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity.

#### Partitioning Strategy:
- Partition the `Posts/Tweets` table by range on `created_at` for older data archival and efficient queries.
- Use list partitioning on the `Notifications` table based on `is_read` to separate active vs. archived notifications.

### 2. Redis Caching Strategy:

#### Timeline Caching Patterns:
- Use Sorted Sets for caching user timelines, scoring posts by creation timestamp for chronological sorting.

#### Session Management:
- Utilize Redis hash maps to store session tokens and associated user data for quick authentication checks.

#### Real-Time Data Caching:
- Implement Pub/Sub mechanisms in Redis for real-time notifications.

#### Cache Invalidation Strategies:
- Leverage TTL (Time To Live) on cached data to automatically invalidate stale data.
- Use cache tagging for grouped invalidation, particularly useful for timeline updates.

### 3. Data Management Patterns:

#### CRUD Operations Optimization:
- Use batch processing for mass insertions or updates (e.g., bulk user registration or post distribution).
- Pre-calculate and store aggregated data such as `likes_count` and `retweets_count` to minimize on-the-fly calculations.

#### Social Graph Queries:
- Implement recursive CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for fetching nth-degree connections.

#### Timeline Generation Algorithms:
- Apply ranking algorithms based on user interactions (likes, retweets) and post recency to dynamically generate personalized timelines.

#### Search and Discovery Data Structures:
- Employ full-text search capabilities of PostgreSQL for content-based search.
- Use GIN indexes to support vector space models for recommendations.

### 4. Performance Optimization:

#### Query Optimization:
- Regularly analyze and tune queries using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for assessing and reducing execution costs.
- Optimize data access patterns, minimizing full table scans.

#### Database Connection Pooling:
- Implement connection pooling to reuse connections and reduce overhead, utilizing tools like PgBouncer or HikariCP.

#### Read Replica Configurations:
- Deploy read replicas to distribute read load, ensuring write operations target the primary database to maintain consistency.

#### Monitoring and Performance Metrics:
- Utilize tools like pg_stat_statements and Prometheus with Grafana for real-time monitoring and performance analytics.

### 5. Data Migration and Versioning:

#### Schema Migration Strategies:
- Use tools like Flyway or Liquibase for managing database migrations, ensuring backward compatibility and minimal downtime.

#### Data Seeding:
- Develop scripts for seeding the database with mock data for development and testing, facilitating realistic performance benchmarks.

### 6. Backup and Recovery:

#### Backup Strategies for PostgreSQL:
- Implement continuous archiving with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) shipping for disaster recovery.
- Schedule regular full and differential backups using pg_dump.

#### Redis Persistence Configuration:
- Configure Redis with both RDB (for point-in-time snapshots) and AOF (Append Only File for every write operation) persistence modes for robust data recovery options.

#### Disaster Recovery Procedures:
- Establish SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for disaster recovery, including backup restorations, read replica promotions, and data integrity checks post-recovery.

This comprehensive approach ensures the Twitter clone is capable of handling large-scale social media workloads, with a focus on scalability, performance, and reliability.
