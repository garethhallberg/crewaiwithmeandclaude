# System Architecture - Phase 2

### 1. High-Level System Architecture:

**Microservices Breakdown and Responsibilities:**

- **User Service:** Manages user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Post Service:** Handles post creation, deletion, and updates.
- **Timeline Service:** Generates and updates user timelines with relevant posts.
- **Notification Service:** Manages real-time notifications for user interactions.
- **Media Service:** Handles media upload, storage, and retrieval.
- **Search Service:** Provides functionalities for searching posts, hashtags, and users.

**Service Communication Patterns:**

- **Synchronous Communication:** Using RESTful APIs for request/response patterns.
- **Asynchronous Communication:** Utilizing message queues (e.g., Kafka) for decoupled services communication, especially for timeline updates and notifications.

**Load Balancing and Scaling Strategies:**

- **Load Balancer:** Nginx or HAProxy to distribute incoming traffic across instances.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to automatically scale services based on demand.

**Container Orchestration Architecture:**

- **Kubernetes Clusters:** Host Docker containers, with microservices efficiently deployed, managed, and scaled across a cluster of servers.

### 2. API Architecture:

**RESTful API Design Principles:**

- **Resource Naming:** Clear, logical naming for resources like `/users`, `/posts`.
- **HTTP Verbs:** Proper use of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for CRUD operations.
- **Statelessness:** Ensuring that each API call can be made independently.

**GraphQL Considerations for Mobile Optimization:**

- Implementing GraphQL for flexible data retrieval, minimizing bandwidth usage on mobile by allowing clients to specify exactly what data is needed.

**WebSocket Architecture for Real-Time Features:**

- Utilizing WebSockets for a persistent, real-time bi-directional communication between clients and servers, enabling features like real-time notifications and live post updates.

**API Versioning Strategy:**

- Use of URI versioning, e.g., `/v1/users`, to maintain backward compatibility while introducing new features.

**Rate Limiting and Throttling:**

- Implement rate limiting to protect the API from overuse and abuse, using a strategy like the token bucket algorithm to allow for burst limits.

### 3. Data Flow Architecture:

**User Data Flow:**

- Registration and authentication flows handled by the User Service, leveraging JWTs for secure, stateless authentication.

**Content Flow:**

- Posts creation through the Post Service, with media processing by the Media Service. The Timeline Service aggregates posts for user timelines.

**Real-Time Data Flow:**

- Notification Service employs WebSockets to push real-time updates to users, enhancing engagement.

**Offline Data Synchronization Strategies:**

- Mobile clients cache relevant data locally, with background synchronization tasks to update local data with server data when back online.

### 4. Scalability Architecture:

**Horizontal Scaling Patterns:**

- Microservices are designed to be stateless where possible, allowing for horizontal scaling by adding more instances as needed.

**Caching Layers and Strategies:**

- Use of Redis for caching hot data, reducing database load. Implement cache aside pattern for cache management.

**CDN Integration for Media Content:**

- Static media content served through a CDN to reduce load on the service and improve load times globally.

**Database Sharding Considerations:**

- PostgreSQL used with sharding strategies for horizontal scalability, distributing data across multiple databases.

### 5. Integration Architecture:

**Mobile App Integration Patterns:**

- RESTful APIs for data exchange between backend and mobile apps, with GraphQL for optimized data loading. WebSocket for real-time features.

**Web App Integration Patterns:**

- React app interacts with backend through RESTful APIs and WebSockets, utilizing modern front-end caching strategies for performance.

**Third-Party Service Integrations:**

- Integration with third-party services like payment gateways or SMS gateways through their APIs, ensuring modular integration within services.

**Cross-Platform Data Consistency:**

- Eventual consistency model supported by asynchronous communication and message queues, ensuring data consistency across platforms without immediate consistency demands.

This architecture leverages Docker for containerization, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments. Kubernetes orchestrates these containers, providing robust deployment, scaling, and management capabilities. This approach ensures that the Twitter clone can efficiently handle millions of users, providing scalability, high availability, and a seamless user experience across web and mobile platforms.
