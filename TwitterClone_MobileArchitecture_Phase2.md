# Mobile Architecture - Phase 2

Unified Mobile Architecture Strategy:

1. **Cross-Platform API Strategy:**
   - **Unified API Contracts:** Implement generic API endpoints that serve both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring data format uniformity.
   - **Platform-specific Optimizations:** Utilize query parameters or headers to allow API to adjust responses based on the platform, optimizing data delivery and minimizing bandwidth usage.
   - **Offline-first Architecture Patterns:** Implement local data storage and synchronization logic to ensure app functionality in offline mode. Use a robust caching mechanism and periodically sync with the server.
   - **Data Synchronization Strategies:** Utilize a combination of push notifications and background fetch to keep local data stores in sync with server data efficiently.

2. **Mobile Performance Architecture:**
   - **Image and Media Caching Strategies:** Implement caching mechanisms like LRU cache for media content to reduce network requests and enhance user experience.
   - **Timeline Pagination and Prefetching:** Use pagination for timeline data with prefetching mechanisms to load and display content smoothly.
   - **Background Sync and Push Notifications:** Integrate background sync processes for data updates along with push notifications for real-time alerts without excessive battery usage.
   - **Battery Optimization Patterns:** Employ battery-efficient technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for location services and limit background activity.

3. **Mobile Security Implementation:**
   - **Secure Token Storage:** Use Keychain for iOS and KeyStore for Android to securely store authentication tokens.
   - **Certificate Pinning Implementation:** Implement certificate pinning to safeguard against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
   - **Biometric Authentication Flows:** Integrate biometric authentication for a secure and user-friendly login experience.
   - **App Transport Security Configuration:** Enforce strict security policies for data transmission, including HTTPS requirements.

4. **Platform-Specific Considerations:**
   - **iOS SwiftUI Navigation and State Management:** Utilize SwiftUI for modern UI construction with native integration of navigation and state management.
   - **Android Jetpack Compose Architecture Patterns:** Adopt Jetpack Compose for modular, readable, and simplified UI development that enhances app performance.
   - **Platform-specific Push Notification Handling:** Implement platform-specific push notification services (APNs for iOS and FCM for Android) for reliable message delivery.
   - **Deep Linking and Universal Links:** Configure deep linking (Android) and universal links (iOS) to support seamless navigation within and outside the app.

5. **Development and Testing Strategy:**
   - **Shared API Testing Approaches:** Implement shared testing frameworks and mock servers to validate API integrations across platforms.
   - **Platform-specific UI Testing:** Leverage XCTest for iOS and Espresso for Android to conduct UI tests that ensure app reliability and usability.
   - **Cross-platform Integration Testing:** Use tools like Postman and Swagger for testing APIs and ensuring integration across mobile and backend services.
   - **Performance Testing on Mobile Devices:** Conduct thorough performance testing using real devices and emulators to simulate various user conditions and network scenarios.

Coordinate these strategies with system, database, and security architectures to ensure a consistent and integrated approach across the entire application infrastructure. Implement the recommended additions from the architecture validation, such as a caching layer for performance, monitoring and logging for observability, and defining a clear scalability approach to support future growth.
