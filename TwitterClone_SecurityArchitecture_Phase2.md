# Security Architecture - Phase 2

### Comprehensive Security Architecture for the Multi-platform Twitter Clone

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Token-Based Authentication:** Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication. Ensure JWTs are securely stored on clients and have a short expiry time to mitigate token theft. 
- **Refresh Token Rotation Strategy:** Refresh tokens will have a longer validity period and will be used to generate new access tokens. Implement token rotation with each refresh request to prevent reuse.
- **OAuth Integration:** Integrate OAuth2 for third-party authentication providers (Google, Apple, Facebook). Ensure scopes are limited based on the required user data.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for an additional security layer. Require MFA setup for actions involving sensitive changes.
- **Biometric Authentication for Mobile:** Leverage device biometric authentication to provide users with a secure and convenient login method.

#### 2. API Security

- **API Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting on APIs to prevent abuse and DOS attacks. Use a sliding log or token bucket algorithms based on use-case.
- **Request Validation and Sanitization:** Ensure all user inputs are validated against expected formats and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **CORS Configuration:** Properly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to ensure that only trusted domains can call your APIs.
- **API Key Management for Mobile Apps:** Implement a secure handshake mechanism for initial app registration. Rotate API keys periodically.
- **SSL/TLS Certificate Management:** Use automated tools like Let's Encrypt for SSL/TLS certificate issuance and renewal to ensure encrypted transmissions.

#### 3. Data Protection

- **Data Encryption In Transit and At Rest:** Implement TLS for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest. Utilize hardware security modules (HSM) for key management.
- **Personal Data Anonymization:** Anonymize or pseudonymize personal data where possible to enhance privacy.
- **GDPR Compliance Implementation:** Implement a comprehensive GDPR compliance framework including consent management, data access controls, and data processing records.
- **Data Retention and Deletion Policies:** Define clear data retention policies and implement automated deletion routines for data that no longer needs to be stored.
- **Audit Logging and Compliance Reporting:** Log access and changes to sensitive user data. Use automated tools for compliance reporting.

#### 4. Application Security

- **Input Validation and SQL Injection Prevention:** Utilize prepared statements and ORM frameworks. Implement strict input validation libraries.
- **XSS and CSRF Protection:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, use anti-CSRF tokens, and validate and sanitize input to prevent XSS.
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Adopt a secure development lifecycle that includes security training for developers, code reviews, and automated static and dynamic analysis tools.
- **Vulnerability Scanning Integration:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline. Act on findings promptly.

#### 5. Infrastructure Security

- **Docker Container Security:** Use minimal base images, scan images for vulnerabilities, enforce immutability, and use user namespaces for isolation.
- **Kubernetes Security Policies:** Implement network policies, Pod Security Policies (or OPA/Gatekeeper), and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Network Security and Firewall Rules:** Define strict firewall rules and segment the network to limit lateral movement within the infrastructure.
- **Secrets Management:** Use vaults for managing secrets (API keys, certificates) and integrate with Kubernetes for automatic secret injections.
- **Security Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring using tools like ELK Stack or Splunk. Set up real-time alerts for suspicious activities.

#### 6. Compliance and Privacy

- **GDPR Article 25 (Privacy by Design):** Incorporate data protection from the initial design stages of the project. Ensure all new features comply with privacy principles.
- **User Consent Management:** Implement a flexible consent management platform that allows users to easily control their data preferences.
- **Right to be Forgotten Implementation:** Provide users with a straightforward interface to request data deletion and automate the data removal process.
- **Data Portability Features:** Enable users to easily export their data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
- **Privacy Policy Technical Implementation:** Translate privacy policy commitments into technical measures. Regularly review and update in line with legal requirements.

### Security Implementation Guidelines and Compliance Checklists

- Develop detailed implementation guides for each security control, outlining configuration steps, and best practices.
- Create comprehensive compliance checklists mapped to each requirement in GDPR and other relevant privacy regulations.
- Prioritize mobile-first security patterns considering the unique threats and vulnerabilities of mobile platforms.
- Ensure containerized deployment security is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline through automated scanning and runtime security enforcement.

This comprehensive security architecture leverages a layered approach addressing authentication, API security, data protection, application and infrastructure security, and compliance and privacy to provide robust protection for the multi-platform Twitter clone.
