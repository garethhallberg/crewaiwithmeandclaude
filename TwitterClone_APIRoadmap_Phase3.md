# API Development Roadmap - Phase 3

To create a detailed API development roadmap and implementation plan for a Twitter clone backend, we must first provide a structured approach that makes use of best practices in API development using Spring Boot and Kotlin, keeping in mind the core API requirements listed. Let's approach this task methodically by breaking down each requirement and planning step-by-step.

### 1. API Endpoint Specifications:

#### User Management and Authentication:
- **Endpoints**:
  - POST `/api/v1/users/signup` for user registration.
  - POST `/api/v1/users/login` for user login/authentication.
  - GET `/api/v1/users/{userId}` to retrieve user profiles.
  - PUT `/api/v1/users/{userId}` to update user profiles.
- **Request/Response Schemas**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications detailing user objects, authentication tokens, error messages, etc.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: JWT-based authentication. Permissions for different user roles.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on key endpoints to prevent abuse.

#### Post/Tweet CRUD Operations:
- **Endpoints**:
  - POST `/api/v1/posts` for creating a new post/tweet.
  - GET `/api/v1/posts/{postId}` to retrieve a specific post/tweet.
  - PUT `/api/v1/posts/{postId}` to update a post/tweet.
  - DELETE `/api/v1/posts/{postId}` to delete a post/tweet.
- **Request/Response Schemas**: JSON objects detailing post data structure.
- **Authentication**: Required for POST, PUT, DELETE operations.

#### Timeline Generation and Retrieval, Social Graph Management, Real-time Notifications, Direct Messaging, Search and Discovery:
- Define endpoints following the same structural approach: endpoint purpose, required authentication, rate limiting considerations, and request/response schemas.

### 2. Development Phases:

**Phase 1: Core APIs (User, Auth, Posts)**
- Focus on getting the basic functionality up and running.
- Core API development should prioritize simplicity and robust security.

**Phase 2: Social Features (Timeline, Following)**
- Implement algorithms for timeline generation based on follows.
- Add functionality for users to follow and unfollow others.

**Phase 3: Real-time Features (Notifications, Messaging)**
- Implement WebSocket for direct messaging and real-time updates.
- Server-sent events (SSE) for non-critical real-time notifications.

**Phase 4: Advanced Features (Search, Analytics)**
- Implement full-text search capabilities for posts and user profiles.
- Introduce basic analytics for post interactions.

### 3. Implementation Priorities:

- **Critical Path API Dependencies**: Identify dependencies between APIs (e.g., authentication before posting).
- **MVP API Subset**: User registration, login, posting, and timeline viewing for initial release.
- **Performance-Critical Endpoints Identification**: Posts and timeline retrieval likely to be most hit.

### 4. API Documentation Strategy:

- **OpenAPI Specification Generation**: Use tools like Swagger to automatically generate API specs.
- **Interactive API Documentation**: Deploy Swagger UI for easy API exploration.
- **Postman Collection Creation**: Provide a Postman collection for easier testing and exploration by developers.
- **Client SDK Generation Considerations**: Plan for future SDKs in different programming languages based on API usage patterns.

### 5. Quality Assurance Plan:

- **Unit Testing Strategy**: Mockito and JUnit for testing services and controllers.
- **Integration Testing**: Use TestContainers for spinning up real databases for testing.
- **API Contract Testing**: Use tools like Pact or Spring Cloud Contract.
- **Performance Testing and Load Testing**: Use JMeter or Gatling for simulating high traffic, identifying bottlenecks.

### 6. Deployment and Versioning:

- **API Versioning**: Use URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`) for simplicity and clarity.
- **Backward Compatibility Maintenance**: Follow best practices for deprecating old endpoints.
- **Feature Flag Integration**: Use feature flags for trialing new features with subsets of users.
- **Staged Rollout Procedures**: Gradually release features to monitor impact on performance and user feedback.

This roadmap prioritizes a solid foundation with core functionalities and robust security features, followed by social, real-time, and advanced features. Emphasis is placed on documentation, quality assurance, and a thoughtful deployment process to ensure a manageable, scalable API. This approach caters to both immediate requirements and future scalability needs, with a mobile-first and cross-platform consistency mindset.
