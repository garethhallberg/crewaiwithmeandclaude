# Timeline/Feed Feature Specification

## Executive Summary
- **What is the timeline feature?**
  - A dynamically updating list of posts from users and followed accounts, providing an engaging user experience by showcasing the latest content in a chronological or popularity-based order.
- **How does it fit into the existing app?**
  - Seamlessly integrates into the TwitterClone app as a core component of the user experience, accessible immediately after login and serving as the primary interaction point.
- **What's the user experience?**
  - Users will scroll through a feed of posts, interact through likes, retweets, and replies, and have the ability to refresh the feed manually or automatically for the latest content.

## iOS Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Patterns
- **MVVM pattern to follow:** Implement the Timeline feature using the MVVM architecture to keep business logic separate from the UI, ensuring code modularity and ease of maintenance.
- **How TimelineView should be structured:**
  - Use `SwiftUI.View` as a container for displaying the list of posts, leveraging existing `List` or custom `ScrollView` implementations for the feed.
- **How TimelineViewModel should work:**
  - Handles fetching of timeline data, managing loading/error states, and providing data to the view to present posts.
- **Integration with existing navigation:**
  - Utilize `NavigationView` and programmatically managed navigation states in ViewModels for seamless integration within the app's navigation flow.

### UI Components
- **List/feed display approach:**
  - Employ a `List` or `ScrollView` for the timeline feed, enabling dynamic content updates and user interactions.
- **Post cell/row design:**
  - Design custom rows for displaying individual posts with user name, timestamp, content, and interaction buttons (like, retweet).
- **Loading states and error handling:**
  - Use enum-based state management to represent loading, success, and error states, updating the UI accordingly.
- **Refresh and pagination (if applicable):**
  - Implement pull-to-refresh and pagination for loading additional posts, ensuring the feed remains engaging with fresh content.

### Data Flow
- **How timeline data is fetched:**
  - The `TimelineViewModel` initiates API calls to fetch timeline data, using asynchronous operations with `async`/`await`.
- **How posts are displayed:**
  - Data fetched is parsed into post models and displayed in the list through data binding using `@Published` properties and `@ObservedObject`.
- **How user interactions are handled:**
  - Implement action handlers in the ViewModel for like, retweet, and reply interactions, updating the UI based on user actions.
- **Integration with existing authentication:**
  - Utilize existing token-based authentication for securing API calls, ensuring timeline content is user-specific and secure.

## Backend Integration

### API Endpoints
- **Which endpoints to use for timeline:**
  - `/api/posts/timeline` for fetching the user-specific timeline.
- **Request format and parameters:**
  - Use `GET` method, with optional query parameters for pagination (`page`, `limit`).
- **Response format and data structure:**
  - JSON response with an array of Post objects, each containing `id`, `content`, `user`, `likes`, `timestamp`, etc.
- **Authentication requirements:**
  - Require JWT in the Authorization header as `Bearer {token}` for accessing the timeline endpoint.

### Data Models
- **Post structure and fields:**
  - Define a `Post` model with properties matching the API response (`id`, `content`, `user`, etc.).
- **Timeline response format:**
  - Ensure the API provides metadata for pagination and number of posts, supporting efficient data handling.
- **Error handling approach:**
  - Implement consistent error response structures across the API, facilitating clear error handling in the app.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Timeline
- **Minimum viable timeline implementation:**
  - Focus on fetching and displaying a basic list of posts, including user interaction capabilities (like, retweet).
- **Essential features only:**
  - Prioritize core functionalities such as post display, refresh capability, and basic user interactions.
- **Following established patterns:**
  - Adhere to the existing MVVM pattern, async data fetching, and UI component reuse.

### Technical Requirements
- **TimelineView implementation details:**
  - Outline the design and structure of the TimelineView, including state management for loading, success, and errors.
- **TimelineViewModel specification:**
  - Define the responsibilities of the TimelineViewModel, including fetching data, handling user interactions, and state management.
- **Integration points with existing code:**
  - Leverage existing authentication, network layer, and UI components for a consistent and efficient implementation.
- **Testing approach:**
  - Develop unit tests for the ViewModel, integration tests for API interaction, and UI tests to ensure a quality user experience.

## Success Criteria
- **What constitutes a working timeline?**
  - A feed that dynamically updates with new posts, supports user interactions, and integrates seamlessly with the app's existing architecture.
- **How to verify it follows existing patterns?**
  - Review against the app's architectural guidelines, ensuring MVVM usage, async data handling, and UI consistency.
- **Integration checkpoints:**
  - Validate the integration with authentication, navigation, and data display components, ensuring a seamless user experience.
